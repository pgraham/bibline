My research focuses on the generation of counterexamples for higher-order logic (Nitpick) and the use of first-order automatic theorem provers in a higher-order theorem prover (Sledgehammer). I am financed by the project Hardening the Hammer (DFG Ni 491/14-1). From 2000 to 2008, I worked as software engineer and documentation manager for Trolltech (now Digia, Qt) in Oslo, Norway."

I am affiliated with the Distributed Programming Laboratory (LPD), under the supervision of Prof. Rachid Guerraoui. I am currently working on the areas of concurrent programming and distributed systems. More precisely, I am mainly interested in synchronization on multi and many-cores. I work on the intersection of software and hardware in order to better understand the intricacies of synchronization.\n\nIn 2011, I completed the Software Engineer of Distributed Systems MSc.  program of the Royal Institute of Technology (KTH), Sweden. As a part of my studies, I did an internship at the Distributed Programming Lab of EPFL with the title \"Design of a Distributed Transactional Memory System for Many-cores\". The internship resulted in a EuroSys '12 paper entitled \"TM2C: a Software Transactional Memory for Many-cores\". After the completion of my internship, I continued working with the LPD lab as a doctoral student. Before that, I studied in the National Technical University of Athens (NTUA), Greece, where I received my diploma in Electrical & Computer Engineering in 2008 with a major in Information Technology (IT).'"
