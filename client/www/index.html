                    Efficient Selectivity And Backup Operators in Monte Carlo
                    Tree Search

                Monte-Carlo evaluation consists in estimating a position by
                averaging the outcome of several random continuations, and can
                serve as an evaluation function at the leaves of a min-max tree.
                This paper presents a new framework to combine tree search with
                Monte-Carlo eval-uation, that does not separate between a
                min-max phase and a Monte-Carlo phase. Instead of backing-up
                the min-max value close to the root, and the average value at
                some depth, a more general backup operator is defined that
                progressively changes from averaging to min-max as the number of
                simulations grows. This approach provides a fine-grained control
                of the tree growth, at the level of individual simulations, and
                allows efficient selectivity methods. This algorithm was
                implemented in a 9 × 9 Go-playing program, Crazy Stone, that won
                the 10th KGS computer-Go tournament.
